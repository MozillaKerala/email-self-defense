				<div class="intro">
					<p>The goal of this guide is to make it easy to set up email encryption on your computer. Once you've finished the guide, you'll be able to send and receive emails that are coded to make sure that a surveillance agent or thief can't intercept your email and read it. </p>
					<p>This isn't something you'd do with every email, or even every day. Rather, it's a tool to have handy when you need to send something sensitive.</p>
					<p>You'll also be able to sign emails to show reliably that they are from you. Though the need for signing may be less obvious, you'll actually do it more often.</p>
					<p>All you need is a computer with GNU/Linux or Windows and an Internet connection. You can use your existing email account for this without affecting it.</p>

						<h3><em>Step 2.a</em> Make a keypair</h3>
						<p>In your email program's menu, select OpenPGP -> Setup Wizard. You don't need to read the text in the window that pops up unless you'd like to, but it's good to read the text on the later screens of the wizard.</p>
						<p>On the second screen, titled "Signing," select "No, I want to create per-recipient rules for emails that need to be signed."</p>
						<p>Use the default options until you reach the screen titled "Create Key".</p>
						<p>On the screen titled "Create Key," pick a strong password! Your password should be at least 8 characters and include at least one lower case and upper case letter and at least one punctuation mark. Don't forget it, or all this work will be wasted!</p>
		  			<p>The program will take a little while to finish the next step, the "Key Creation" screen. While you wait, do something else with your computer, like watching a movie or browsing the Web. The more you use the computer at this point, the faster the key creation will go.</p>
						<p>When the OpenPGP Confirm screen pops up, select Generate Certificate and choose to save it in a safe place on your computer (we recommend making a folder called "Revocation Certificate" in your home folder and keeping it there. You'll learn more about the revocation certificate in Section 5. The setup wizard will ask you to move it onto an external device, but that isn't necessary at this moment.</p>
						<p class="highlight">After creating your key, the Enigmail set-up wizard automatically uploaded it to a keyserver, an online computer that makes everyone's keys available through the Internet.</p>

<p>To encrypt and email to Adele, you need her public key, and so now you'll have Enigmail download it from a keyserver. Click Download Missing Keys and use the default in the pop-up that asks you to choose a keyserver. Once it finds keys, check the first one (Key ID starting with 9), then select ok. Select ok in the next pop-up.</p>

<p>Now you are back at the "Recipients not valid, not trusted or not found" screen. Select Adele's key from the list and click Ok. If the message doesn't send automatically, you can hit send now.</p>

						<h2><em>#4</em> Learn the Web of Trust</h2>
					</div><!-- /.sidebar -->
					<!-- ~~~~~~~~~ section introduction: interspersed text  ~~~~~~~~~ -->
					<div class="main">
						<p>Email encryption is a powerful technology, but it has a weakness; it requires a way to verify that a person's keypair is actually theirs. Otherwise, there would be no way to stop an attacker from making an email address with your friends name, creating a keypair to go with it and impersonating your friend. They would then be able to impersonate your friend by signing messages with the private key they'd created, and decrypt messages intended for your friend with the public key.</p>
						<p>That's why the programmers that developed email encryption created keysigning and the Web of Trust. Keysigning allows a person to publicly state that they trust that a public key belongs to a specific person. To sign someone's public key, you need to use your private key, so the world will know that it was you.</p>

					</div><!-- /.sidebar -->
					<div class="main">
						<h3><em>Step 4.a</em> Sign a key</h3>
						<p>In your email program's menu, go to OpenPGP -> Key Management.</p>
						<p>Right click on Adele's public key and select Sign Key from the context menu.</p>
						<p>In the window that pops up, select "I will not answer" and click OK.</p>
						<p>In your email program's menu, go to OpenPGP -> Key Management -> Keyserver -> Upload Public Keys and hit OK.</p>
						<p class="highlight">You've just effectively said "I trust that Adele's public key actually belongs to Adele." This doesn't mean much because Adele isn't a real person. Before signing a real person's key, always make sure it actually belongs to them, and answer honestly in the window that pops up and asks "How carefully have you verified that the key you are about to sign actually belongs to the person(s) named above?".</p>
						<p class="highlight">It's important to take keysigning seriously because it will affect people beyond just you and the person who's key you are signing. If someone doubts that a key actually belongs to the person that is says it does, they can go on a keyserver and see the number of signatures that it has. The more it has, the more they are likely to trust it.</p>
						<p class="highlight">The Web of Trust takes this concept to the next level. It is a network of key signatures that is saved in keyservers on the Internet. It builds chains of trust between individuals that do not know each other by passing through others, a bit like the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">"six degrees of separation" game</a>. You don't need to understand it in detail to use email encryption, but it will become a powerful tool if you become an advanced user.</p>

						<h3><em>Step 5a</em> When should I encrypt? When should I sign?</h3>
						<p>Everyone uses GnuPG a little differently. Encryption is most important for messages involving finances, personal information, politically sensitive conversations and anything else that you wouldn't want to fall into the wrong hands. Signing is best for when you think there might be concern about your identity, or as a way of demonstrating that you know how to use GnuPG and will be able to decrypt emails. If you're already encrypting, there's no reason not to sign as well, to give the recipient added assurance that the message is from you.</p>
						<p>If you're using your email program (or wherever you have GnuPG set up) often, we recommend that you sign all outgoing messages because it turns you into an ambassador for GnuPG. Anyone can read a signed email, so it doesn't matter if the recipient doesn't yet know how to use email encryption. The more you encrypt the better, but you won't be able to do so unless the recipient has a public key. However, if you've set it up for an email program on your computer, but you primarily use email through your phone, then you'll only want to fire up the email program and use GnuPG for special occasions. If this describes you, we recommend you use </p>

This guide doesn't cover how to revoke a key, but it only takes a minute. We recommend you Google it or seek help from a skilled friend. After you're done revoking, send an email to everyone with whom you usually use your key to make sure they know.</p>
