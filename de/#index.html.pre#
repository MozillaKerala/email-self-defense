					Bulk surveillance violates our fundamental rights and makes free speech risky. This guide will teach you a basic surveillance self-defense skill: email encryption. Once you've finished, you'll be able to send and receive emails that are coded to make sure that a surveillance agent or thief that intercepts your email can't read it. All you need is a computer with an Internet connection, an email account and about half an hour.</p>

<p>Even if you have nothing to hide, using encryption helps protect the privacy of people you communicate with, and makes life difficult for bulk surveillance systems. If you do have something important to hide, you're in good company; these are the same tools that Edward Snowden used to share his famous secrets about the NSA.</p>

<p>In addition to using encryption, standing up to surveillance requires fighting politically for a <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">reduction in the amount of data collected on us</a>, but the essential first step is to protect yourself and make surveillance of your communication as difficult as possible. Let's get started!</p>

<p class="notes">This guide relies on software which is freely licensed; it's completely transparent and anyone can copy it or make their own version. This makes it safer from surveillance than proprietary software (like Windows). Learn more about free software at <a href="https://u.fsf.org/ys">fsf.org</a>.</p>

<p>Most GNU/Linux operating systems come with GnuPG installed on them, so you don't have to download it. Before configuring GnuPG though, you'll need a desktop email program installed on your computer. Most GNU/Linux distributions have a free software version of the Thunderbird email program available to install. This guide will work with them, in addition to Thunderbird itself. Email programs are another way to access the same email accounts you can access in a browser (like GMail), but provide extra features.</p>
                        <p>If you are already have one of these, you can skip to <a href="#step-1b">Step 1.b</a>.</p>
